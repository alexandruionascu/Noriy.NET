=====
<h2> Introduction </h2>

Noriy.NET is a cloud platform for web safety, parental control and web traffic administration. It is perfect for schools, libraries, families, and even enterprises. It provides cloud service, web application dashboard for administration and desktop client application. The client works on all versions of Windows, and it is runnable partially on Linux with Mono. 
<h2>Features </h2>

<h4> Blacklist </h4>

This is a common feature for any similar application and also a crucial one. In Noriy.NET, the websites are being checked before in order to prevent accessing a blocked Url. However, in Noriy.NET the administrator is being assisted by community’s feedback in order to make the right decisions. In this way, the blacklist feature is being extended, the community helps you and also you help the community. The filter cannot be disabled by users. Otherwise, the whole Internet access is disabled until the administrator enters the password.

<h4> Categories </h4>

We also include a very popular list of potentially dangerous websites – UrlBlacklist from Dans Guardian. It became popular among Squid users. It includes over 2.000.000 websites and domains from over 90 categories. In Noriy.NET, when someone access a website from a category selected by the administrator, the websites goes into the administrator alerts panel. Then, he will have the chance to see the community’s rating or social rating, and then he may block it or not.

<h4> Traffic </h4>

It is a standard feature but not crucial for Noriy.NET. Registering traffic is optional and it can be enabled / disabled by anyone. It can be used on very small children or newcomers.

<h4> Friends </h4>

Noriy.NET lets you have a friends list. When you connect with facebook, the friends who already use Noriy.NET are automatically imported into the user friends list. Also, it works with standard Noriy.NET username, but social media integration is a huge boost.

When a user access a website block by a friend, then the website goes into the alerts panel of the administrator. Then, he will again decide whether is it dangerous or not.

Privacy is being kept. Friends data is private, user’s data is not shared. Users will know if one of their friends blocked the website, but the anonymity remains.

<h4> Feedback </h4>

Being based on community is a great advantage. We offer safety ratings and social safety rating based on community’s experience. This is represented as a percentage from 0 – 100%, meaning that a website with 100% is totally safe.

<h4> Web of Trust </h4>

Community-based services have been already a successful idea. Over 130 million people downloaded the Web of Trust browser plugin and it’s one of the highest rated plugins ever made.

Implementing a similar feature may be difficult considering that a high number of users are required. That’s why we consider a good strategy to integrate the Web of Trust API in Noriy.NET in order to promote and launch our product. In this way, we will have the power of a huge community of millions of people. There are already 53 million rated websites so far, and the number is growing. There are almost 400.000 new community ratings every month.

Web of Trust will make the users more confident in their choices. When a website is blocked, the Web of Trust Rating will appear. We encourage in this way to make the right choices by blocking only the websites with low rating.

<h4> Alerts </h4>

It is a list of domains / websites the administrator has to stay aware. More precisely, it is a collection of websites accessed by the user and there is a reason behind it. They may be blocked by a friend, they may be in one selected category from UrlBlacklist or a Noriylet considers it as a threat.

<h4> Statistics </h4>

They are a key part in web content filtering services. They provide meaningful information in order to improve the experience. Noriy.NET shows you how many times your computer was under a threat.

<h4> Mobile </h4>

The user interface of the web app is designed to work even on mobile devices, especially on tablets. The administrator doesn’t have to be on the computer, he can manage Noriy.NET from everywhere.

<h4> Noriylets </h4>

The community is essential for Noriy.NET. Not only users contribute, but also the developers. If you want a certain feature, don’t worry! Noriy.NET supports extensions, plugins which we call them Noriylets. It is very easy to build a Noriylet, and then, after is accepted by the team, it will be available to download for everyone. For more information, please check the developer’s documentation.

Basically, there are endless opportunities. Artificial intelligence, semantic web and so many other features can be implemented and combined with the community’s feedback.
